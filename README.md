# f1-dashboard
This project uses the JamStack technique, where frontend and backend is hosted separately. 



## My Learning Journey 
1. Initialised the project (27/11/25)
  - Split root directory into client (frontend Vite + React) and server (backend ExpressJS)
  - Created a .env file in server for PORT_SERVER
  - Used CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow frontend to access data from backend, and bypass SOP (Same Origin Policy)
  - Gitignore for .env file and node_modules folder
